<p id="p1" >I have started learning web development this year.
 And inorder to learn it I have chosen GDG on campus AASTU club.
I have chosen this club because it is more experianced and also more organized club than
other clubs that teaches web development.
This club has many mentors that are highly expreianced in the course that they teach.
So my web development journy started with learning simple html course.
html is easily understandable course but among the important element for web development because it gives structure for our web page.
Then I proceed learning Css for puropse beutifying the web page
 that we already structured with html language.Now this is the first 
project after learning both css and html.</p>
